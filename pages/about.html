            <h1> What's up! I'm Chase.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I’m a passionate UX/UI designer hailing from the sunny shores of Huntington Beach, CA. With a knack for blending creativity and functionality, I've cultivated my skills not only in design but also in the realms of digital marketing and web development.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've honed my craft through rigorous training, having completed three intensive bootcamps at UT Austin. These include a comprehensive full-stack web development bootcamp, a dynamic UX/UI design bootcamp, and an insightful digital marketing bootcamp. My commitment is underscored by the certificates of completion I proudly hold for each.
                <br>
                <br>
                While my days are currently spent as a valet in the picturesque Newport Beach, CA, my sights are set on a vibrant career. I'm on the lookout for a full-time role as either a junior UX/UI designer or an SEO strategist, where I can channel my diverse skill set into creating compelling digital experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                What makes me stand out in the world of UX/UI design is my unique background in web development. I believe this dual expertise enhances the designer-to-developer handoff process, ensuring a seamless translation of vision into reality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond the pixels and code, I find joy in the outdoors. Whether it's casting a line while fishing, carving through fresh powder on a snowboard, or perfecting tricks on a skateboard, I embrace the thrill of adventure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Join me on this creative journey, where design meets development, and let's craft digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
                <br>

                <h3>Tropical Storm Hilary</h3>
                <p>Here I can be seen observing the winds & surf in Newport Beach, CA while also discarding of a broken umbrella. This image was taken as tropical storm Hilary made her way into the SoCal bight. Hilary prompted local weather forecasters to issue SoCal's first ever tropical storm warnings & watches! I also obeserved sea-level snow fall--in Orange County--earlier in the same year. The wather nerd in me was geeking to say the least.</p>
